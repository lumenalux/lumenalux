## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª About Me 

I'm a software developer deeply engaged in AI technologies with diverse experience in developing software solutions for a range of organizations and domains. I've configured weather stations for air quality monitoring, built donation management systems for charitable organizations, and contributed to the development of telecom and STEM educational tools.
